\begin{itemize}
  \setlength\itemsep{-1pt}
\item \emph{Developed a dialogue manager} as part of the undergraduate course requirement%As part of the undergraduate course requirement, I presented a thesis report of the research project, in which I developed a model for a dialogue manager with tighter integration of the backend and user input learning. Also while working as a temporary demonstrator at the University of Peradeniya, I conducted research on dialogue management and machine learning, an extension of my final year research project.
  \vspace{-3pt}
  \begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{-3pt}
  \item The model maps the user input to back-end directly using a classification approach.
  \item Assumes the primitive for ``meaning'' in machines is functions.
  \item Tested using Naive bayes and maxent.
  \end{itemize}
\item \emph{Automating various facets of restaurant} as part of current project%Currently I am employed as a research assistant, where I conduct research on computer vision and deep learning applications. The research project’s current focus is to build a system to automate billing in a restaurant, with computer vision as the primary method. Also we are using the Nvidia Jetson platform as the deployment device, and are experimenting with a wide range of deep learning algorithms and architectures.
  \vspace{-3pt}
  \begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{-3pt}
  \item Developed prototype restaurant cashier automation(uses deep learning and computer vision)
  \item Experimented with broad range of different approaches:
    \\Classification and object detection for identifying food
    \\Regression and object detection for amount/count
  \item Addressed problems such as:
    \vspace{-3pt}
    \begin{itemize}

    \item Optimal data and model that generalizes well and is accurate.
    \item The system design to ensure accurate and robust results in production environment.
    \item Development of pipeline for rapid experimentation and deployment of models.

\item Artificial General Intelligence.
\item Combining the GOFAI and DL based AI.
\item Adaptive intelligent systems.
\item Theoretical understanding of deep learning.
\item ``Meaning'' in the context of AI.
\end{itemize}
%My primary research interest is in artificial general intelligence. Understanding human intelligence, developing intelligent systems that can improve life in general and understanding their impact on society have been great interests of mine. I am particularly interested in data-driven intelligent systems and what “meaning” is in such systems. As such, I am also interested in the merger of deep learning approaches and symbolic artificial intelligence (GOFAI) and in systems that can adapt while deployed.
